# Submitting a Map

## General Guidance for prepping a map
- Pull the most recent module update, import module into your world, import all scenes
- Wall and Light your map
- Create a scene compendium (in the world) named 'community-fragmaps-maps'
- Add all (FragMap) scenes to this compendium (This is important so none of the scene files overlap in filenames)
- Go into your file manager, delete module 'community-fragmaps-maps' folder, drag your world compendium folder into its place.
- Upload all files for pull request

### If you have any issues, submit an issue - include a zipped version of your maps for testing.

## Restrictions
- Maps must only contain the Free variants of maps.
- Content cannot include collaboration content.
- Push requests cannot contain any Patron Exclusive content.
- Push requests must not contain any module-specific content.*

*(At the moment, may add additional branches for module use - such as levels, parallax, and others.)
