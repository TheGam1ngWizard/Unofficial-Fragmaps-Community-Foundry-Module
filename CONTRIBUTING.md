# Submitting a Map

## General Guidance for prepping a map
- Pull the most recent module update, import module into your world, import all scenes
- Wall and Light your map
- Create a scene compendium (in the world) named 'community-fragmaps-maps'
- Add all (FragMap) scenes to this compendium (This is important so none of the scene files overlap in filenames)
- Go into your file manager, delete module 'community-fragmaps-maps' folder, drag your world compendium folder into its place.
- Upload all files for pull request

### If you have any issues, submit an issue - include a zipped version of your maps for testing.

## Restrictions
- Maps **must** only contain the Free variants of maps.
- This module **may not** include any maps already published in the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fragmaps-free module (if they do another batch, we will move any maps done into a seperate branch not provided by the main module.)
- Collaboration content will **not** be allowed in this module.
- Push requests **can not** contain any Patron Exclusive content.
- Push requests **can not** contain any module-specific content.*

*(At the moment, may add additional branches for module use - such as levels, parallax, and others.)

## Additional Notes
- Add a name/alias in the collaborators section of the README.md document _if you want_.
